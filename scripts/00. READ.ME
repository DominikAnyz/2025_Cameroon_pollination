This script serves as a walkthrough of all the scripts contains in this 
repository. 

All the individual sripts have their own descriptions about what each segment of
code does, this should help with making sense of why individual steps needed to 
be taken.

All analyses were carried out on MetaCentrum, which provides an online
computation infrastructure for researchers. Because of this, I was able to run
many of the bayesian models through rstan easily, however if you are running 
the code on your computer, it might not work and certain parameters for the 
individual models might have to be set differently.

COME BACK TO THIS!!!!!!!!!

###* 01.Setup_for_analysis

The script contains all the packages, which are used throughout the scripts. 
This is handy to run if you will be carrying out all the analyses again, 
however is not necessary. If you are interested only in a certain script, it 
might be easier to load the packages in each script separately. If you do not
have cmdstanr on your computer for running Bayesian analyses, this might take a
while.

###* 02.Cleaning_raw_seedset_data

This script take the raw data collected from finished seeds and cleans the
dataset, so it doesn't contain any unusable observations. The dataset is
striped of any seedsets, where the comment would suggest infestation, loss of
flower or uncertainty of treatment.

###* 03.GLMM_pollination_indices

This script contains all the code used to run glmm's for the four indices, which
were used to assess the effect of elevation of them.

###* 04.Setup_for_visitation_indices

The script is used to setup the datasets for the analyses of individual 
pollination indices. It has a similar setup as 06.Setup_for_index_comparisons.
This script has data aggregated at individual observation level, wheras 06. has 
data aggregated at elevation and species level. Although it might seem like a 
small change, the code would have been more complicated if one script was to be
made for both datasets, so we chose to separate it into two.

Both of these setup scripts pull datasets "visitors.txt" and "functional.txt",
which have been altered outside R. For full transperancy, here is the process in
which they were created:

The aquired data for visitors was in the form of excels, 7 for each species for 
each elevation (provided that the species was in a given elevation).

It was necessary to combine all the excels into one. The steps for the 
combining all the excels can be found in the document "Processing steps" in the 
folder "process".

TLDR; first it is necessary to check that all excels are filled in correctly. 
This was done manually. All the excels can be found in the file "elevation 
excels". Next, it was necessary to export every excel as a csv to make the files 
as small as possible. This was done with the "xls to csv converter" in the 
"process" folder. The csv's (found in folder "csv files") were then combined and 
the original version of the combined document if under the name "_combined" in 
the file "csv files".

***visitors.txt***

This csv file was imported into an xls file labeled "Pollination necessary". 
In this excel the unecessary columns were deleted. Also, all the names of 
identified visitors were exported and added to special excel "Cameroon 
grasslands species" and it was checked if any of the names used were not used 
differently between the excels. The names were unified by the visitor 
identifiers (the people who ID'd the visitors) every time one species was the 
same as another, it is recorded in the excel and then the name for each given 
species is bolded. I identifiers also recorded whether or not the visitor can 
be identified as "morphospecies" or not.

The information from this excel was transported into the excel "Pollination 
necessary", from which the .txt file "visitors" was created.

***functional.txt***

The text document "functional.txt" was created from the excel "Cameroon 
grassland species". After all the visitors have been identified, only the 
columns "SD.s.ID" (Sylvain Delabye's ID) and "functional.group" (which 
functional group the visitor belongs to) were exported into this .txt file.

The following functional groups were used: Bee, Wasp, Hoverfly, Other fly, 
Beetle, Butterfly, Moth and Bird

###* 05.GLMM_visitation_indices

This script contains all the code used to run glmm's for the three visitation
indices, which were used to assess the effect of elevation of them.
