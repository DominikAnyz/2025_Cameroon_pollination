## Manuscript Draft

This repository contains the R scripts and data used to carry out analyses for this research article:

**Anýž et al., unpublished - Elevational pattern in plant mating systems and pollen limitation in Afrotropical montane grasslands** [Link to be posted]()

🌱🌰 *This project is a part of the PhD thesis of [Dominik Anýž](http://www.insect-communities.cz/en/team/dominik-anyz/), supervised by [Robert Tropek](http://www.insect-communities.cz/en/team/robert-tropek/) at the Insect Community Ecology Group of Charles University.*

## Folder Structure

## How to run it

This analysis pipeline is written in the statistical programming language R. To run the analyses, you will need to have installed on your local computer [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/), and optionally [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can download the entire project as a `.zip` from this [URL](https://github.com/SaileeSakhalkar/Pollination-Cameroon/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). After unzipping:

-   Open the `Pollination-Cameroon.Rproj` file, found at the root of the project, in RStudio

-   Run either the 00_setup.R or sequentially the scripts found in the [📁 scripts](/scripts/) folder. It will rebuild the model outputs and figures presented in the main text of the article.
