## Manuscript Draft

This repository contains the R scripts and data used to carry out analyses for this research article:

**Anýž et al., unpublished - Elevational pattern in plant mating systems and pollen limitation in Afrotropical montane grasslands** [Link to be posted]()

🌱🌰 *This project is a part of the PhD thesis of [Dominik Anýž](http://www.insect-communities.cz/en/team/dominik-anyz/), supervised by [Robert Tropek](http://www.insect-communities.cz/en/team/robert-tropek/) at the Insect Community Ecology Group of Charles University.*

## Folder Structure

Out of the six folders in this repository, two are necessary for reproducibility of the results: [📁 scripts](/scripts/) and [📁 data](/data/). Before running any scripts, go through the README in **scripts**. **data** has it's own REAMDE explaining any and all manipulation carried out on the data, however the same information is repeated in the README of **scripts**, since it is usefull for understanding the process. 

Folder [📁 brms_models](/brms_models/) contain all models generated during the process of creating the manuscript. Folder [📁 figs](/figs/) contain figures generated during the process of creating the manuscript. Folder [📁 tables](/tables/) contain figures generated during the process of creating the manuscript. Folders [📁 unused](/unused/), which can be found in the main repo and withing different folders are not useless, just not used anymore. 

## How to run it

This analysis pipeline is written in the statistical programming language R. To run the analyses, you will need to have installed on your local computer [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/), and optionally [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can download the entire project as a `.zip` from this [URL](https://github.com/SaileeSakhalkar/Pollination-Cameroon/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). After unzipping:

-   Open the `2025_Cameroon_pollination.Rproj` file, found at the root of the project, in RStudio

-   Open folder [📁 scripts](/scripts/) and run the scripts sequentially, from 01. to 07. It will rebuild the model outputs and figures presented in the main text of the article.
