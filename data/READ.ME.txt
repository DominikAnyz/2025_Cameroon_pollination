This READ.ME is meant to summarize the files in this folder

The document Mt.Cameroon seed count raw is the data which was collected.
The only changes made to this document are that if a specimen was missing
a plant number, a unique number would be appointed to it as to not be 
tied with any one other plant number.

The manipulation with the rest of the data was carried out using a code in
R, specifically code "Cleaning raw data"
