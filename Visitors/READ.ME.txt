This READ.ME file aims to best describe the process of reorganizing the visitors data.

The aquired data for visitors was in the form of excels, 7 for each species for each elevation
(provided that the species was in a given elevation).

Next it was necessary to combine all the excels into one. The steps for the combining all the excels
can be found in the document "Processing steps" in the folder "process".

TLDR; first it is necessary to check that all excels are filled in correctly. This was done manually.
All the excels can be found in the file "elevation excels". Next, it was necessary to export every 
excel as a csv to make the files as small as possible. This was done with the "xls to csv converter" 
in the "process" folder. The csv's (found in folder "csv files") were then combined and the original 
version of the combined document if under the name "_combined" in the file "csv files".

***Visitors2.txt***

This csv file was imported into an xls file labeled "Pollination necessary". In this excel the 
unecessary columns were deleted. Also, all the names of identified visitors were exported and 
added to special excel "Cameroon grasslands species" and it was checked if any of the names 
used were not used differently between the excels. The names were unified by the visitor identifiers 
(the people who ID'd the visitors) every time one species was the same as another, it is recorded in 
the excel and then the name for each given species is bolded. I identifiers also recorded whether or 
not the visitor can be identified as "morphospecies" or not.

The information from this excel was transported into the excel "Pollination necessary", from which 
the .txt file "Visitors 2" was created.

All other manipulation with the data is done in the R code "Visitors"

***functional.txt***

The text document "functional.txt" was created from the excel "Cameroon grassland species". After all
the visitors have been identified, only the columns "SD.s.ID" (Sylvain Delabye's ID) and 
"functional.group" (which functional group the visitor belongs to) were exported into this .txt file.

The following functional groups were used: Bee, Wasp, Hoverfly, Other fly, Beetle, Butterfly, 
Moth and Bird
