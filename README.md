## Manuscript Draft

This repository contains the R scripts and data used to carry out
analyses for this research article:

**Anýž et al., unpublished - Elevational pattern in plant mating systems
and pollen limitation in Afrotropical montane grasslands** [Link to be
posted]()

🌱🌰 *This project is a part of the PhD thesis of [Dominik
Anýž](http://www.insect-communities.cz/en/team/dominik-anyz/),
supervised by [Robert
Tropek](http://www.insect-communities.cz/en/team/robert-tropek/) at the
Insect Community Ecology Group of Charles University.*

## Folder Structure

Out of the five folders in this repository, two are necessary for
reproducibility of the results: **scripts** and **data**. Before running
any scripts, go through the README in **scripts**. **data** has it’s own
REAMDE explaining any and all manipulation carried out on the data,
however the same information is repeated in the README of **scripts**,
since it is usefull for understanding the process.

Folders **figs** contain figures generated during the process of
creating the manuscript. Folders **tables** contain figures generated
during the process of creating the manuscript. Folders **unused**, which
can be found in the main repo and withing different folders are not
useless, just not used anymore.

## How to run it

This analysis pipeline is written in the statistical programming
language R. To run the analyses, you will need to have installed on your
local computer [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/), and optionally
[RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can download the entire project as a `.zip` from this
[URL](https://github.com/SaileeSakhalkar/Pollination-Cameroon/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
After unzipping:

- Open the `Pollination-Cameroon.Rproj` file, found at the root of the
  project, in RStudio

- Run either the 00_setup.R or sequentially the scripts found in the [📁
  scripts](/scripts/) folder. It will rebuild the model outputs and
  figures presented in the main text of the article.
