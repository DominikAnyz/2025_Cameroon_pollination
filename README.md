## How to run it

This analysis pipeline is written in the statistical programming
language R. To run the analyses, you will need to have installed on your
local computer [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/), and optionally
[RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can download the entire project as a `.zip` from this
[URL](https://github.com/SaileeSakhalkar/Pollination-Cameroon/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
After unzipping:

- Open the `Pollination-Cameroon.Rproj` file, found at the root of the
  project, in RStudio

- Run either the 00_setup.R or sequentially the scripts found in the [📁
  scripts](/scripts/) folder. It will rebuild the model outputs and
  figures presented in the main text of the article.
